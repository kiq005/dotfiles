# dotfiles
My dot files, to make life easier. The dotfiles were made for Arch Linux, but I'll try to keep it compatible with other systems.

## Files
On main, you'll find configurations files for:
- Vim
- Tmux

There is also:
- Bash aliases

## What you will need:
All tmux plugins are installed with [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm). To install it:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```
